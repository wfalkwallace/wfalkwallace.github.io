Imagine a giant cock flying towards your mouth, and there's nothing you can do
about it.  And you're like "Oh man, I'm gonna have to suck this thing", and you
brace yourself to suck this giant cock.  But then, at the last moment, it
changes trajectory and hits you in the eye.  You think to yourself "Well, at
least I got that out of the way", but then the giant cock rears back and stabs
your eye again, and again, and again.  Eventually, this giant cock is
penetrating your gray matter, and you begin to lose control of your motor
skills.  That's when the giant cock slaps you across the cheek, causing you to
fall out of your chair.  Unable to move and at your most vulnerable, the giant

Soon Unix had the mass of Andre the Giant, the body of the Elephant Man, and the
mind of a forgotten Jack Nicholson character.

The worst strain was on Unix's mind.  Unable to assimilate all the conflicting
patchworks of features it had ingested, its personality began to fragment into
millions of distinct, incompatible operating systems.  People would cautiously say
"good morning Unix.  And who are we today?" and it would reply "Beastie" (BSD), or
"Domain", or "I'm System III, but I'll be System V tomorrow." Psychiatrists
labored for years to weld together the two major poles of Unix's personality,
"Beasty Boy", an inner-city youth from Berkeley, and "Belle", a southern
transvestite who wanted a to be a woman.  With each attempt, the two poles would
mutate, like psychotic retroviruses, leaving their union a worthless blob of
protoplasm requiring constant life support to remain compatible with its parent
personalities.

Finally, unbalanced by its own cancerous growth, Unix fell into a vat of toxic
radioactive wombat urine, from which it emerged, skin white and hair green.  It
smelled like somebody's dead grandmother.

Bruce Schneier used to shave with Occam's razor, but decided growing a manly beard
was simpler.

The thing you have to remember about "hacker news" is that nothing posted there is
news and none of the people who frequent it are hackers.  "Web Developer with an

same ring as "news." -- Kurt H. Maier
